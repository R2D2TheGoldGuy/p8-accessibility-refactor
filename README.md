# Project 8 - Accessibility Refactor

Main Objective: Take a set of interlinked pages that suffer from various accessibility flaws and refine and update them so they are accessible and pass an accessibility validator(s)'s automated checks and a human's check.

Note: These projects are intended to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement the designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
